                    Hi I'm Ray and I love to design and make things. This passion has lead me on journeys from clothing
                    and graphic design, into web design, web development and software engineering. I also have a huge
                    interest in sound design and audio production.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">My current field of interest and obsession is UX Design. I'm busy
                    learning everything I can about this sub-genre of design. I'm leaning on my previous experience,
                    while combining it with a wealth of new info.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Design can be a solo pursuit or a team activity. I enjoy both, but
                    especially those challenging projects tackled with an enthusiastic team.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">When I'm not doing the above mentioned things you won't find me watching
                    TV, ever! You might catch me out in the surf testing some fins I have made, on the estuary
                    kiteboarding or stand-up paddle boarding with my family.</p>
